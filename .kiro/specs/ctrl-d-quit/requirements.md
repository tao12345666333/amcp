# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for quitting the `amcp agent` interactive mode using Ctrl+D (EOF signal) in addition to the existing `exit` command. This provides a more natural terminal experience consistent with other CLI tools.

## Glossary

- **Agent Interactive Mode**: The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface where users interact with the agent through a command-line prompt
- **EOF Signal**: End-of-File signal generated by pressing Ctrl+D on Unix-like systems or Ctrl+Z on Windows
- **EOFError**: Python exception raised when the input() function encounters an EOF signal

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quit the agent interactive mode using Ctrl+D, so that I can exit quickly using standard terminal conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+D in the agent interactive mode THEN the system SHALL catch the EOFError exception and exit gracefully
2. WHEN the system exits via Ctrl+D THEN the system SHALL display a goodbye message to the user
3. WHEN the system exits via Ctrl+D THEN the system SHALL save the conversation history before exiting
4. WHEN the system exits via Ctrl+D THEN the system SHALL perform the same cleanup as the existing 'exit' command
5. THE system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing exit commands ('exit', 'quit', 'q')
