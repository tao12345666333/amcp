# Security Guidance Plugin

Security validation hooks that monitor dangerous patterns and provide warnings before potentially risky operations.

## Overview

This plugin uses the new simplified Markdown hook format to define security rules. Instead of complex TOML or JSON configurations, you write hooks in Markdown with YAML frontmatter.

## Features

- **Pattern-based detection** - Regex patterns to catch dangerous operations
- **Flexible actions** - Warn, block, or ask for confirmation
- **Easy configuration** - Simple Markdown format
- **Multiple security checks**:
  - Dangerous shell commands
  - Credential exposure
  - Dangerous file operations
  - Security anti-patterns

## Hooks

### `block-dangerous-commands.md`
Blocks extremely dangerous shell commands like `rm -rf /`, `dd if=`, etc.

### `warn-credential-exposure.md`
Warns when writing files that might contain credentials.

### `warn-security-antipatterns.md`
Warns about common security anti-patterns in code.

## Hook Format (Simplified Markdown)

The new Markdown hook format is easy to read and write:

```markdown
---
name: my-security-hook
enabled: true
event: bash              # or: file, stop, session_start, session_end, prompt
action: warn             # or: block
pattern: rm\s+-rf
---

⚠️ **Warning Message**

Detailed explanation of the warning.
Why this is dangerous and what to do instead.
```
