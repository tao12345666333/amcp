# Code Review Skill

When reviewing code, follow these best practices:

## Review Checklist
1. **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
3. **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance issues?
4. **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
5. **Testing**: Is the code adequately tested?
6. **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?

## Review Guidelines
- Be constructive and kind
- Focus on the code, not the coder
- Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
- Explain the "why" behind your suggestions
- Prioritize issues by severity

## Common Issues to Look For
- Magic numbers and strings
- Duplicated code
- Long functions or methods
- Deep nesting
- Missing error handling
- Hardcoded values
- Poor naming conventions
