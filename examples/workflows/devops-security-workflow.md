# DevOps Security Workflow Example

This workflow demonstrates how DevOps and Security agents can collaborate to create secure, production-ready infrastructure and deployment pipelines.

## Workflow Overview

```
User Request → DevOps Engineer Agent → Security Auditor Agent → Documentation Writer Agent → Final Result
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Initial Request (User → DevOps Engineer)

**User Input:**
```
"I need to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for my web application with Docker containerization, Kubernetes deployment, automated testing, and comprehensive security measures. The pipeline should include security scanning, vulnerability assessment, and compliance monitoring."
```

**DevOps Engineer Agent Tasks:**
- Design the overall infrastructure architecture
- Create Dockerfile and container configuration
- Set up Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Configure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)
- Implement automated testing integration
- Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Create backup and disaster recovery procedures

### 2. Security Review (DevOps Engineer → Security Auditor)

**Delegation Prompt:**
```
"Please perform a comprehensive security audit of the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure I've designed. Check for security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and provide recommendations for hardening the deployment."
```

**Security Auditor Agent Tasks:**
- Analyze container security and image vulnerabilities
- Review Kubernetes security configurations
- Assess CI/CD pipeline security
- Check network security and firewall rules
- Validate secrets management and encryption
- Review access control and permissions
- Provide security hardening recommendations

### 3. Security Implementation (DevOps Engineer)

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Apply security recommendations from the audit
- Implement security scanning in the pipeline
- Configure network policies and firewalls
- Set up secrets management (HashiCorp Vault/AWS Secrets Manager)
- Implement security monitoring and alerting
- Configure compliance checks and reporting

### 4. Documentation Creation (DevOps Engineer → Documentation Writer)

**Delegation Prompt:**
```
"Please create comprehensive documentation for the secure CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure, including setup guides, security procedures, and operational runbooks."
```

**Documentation Writer Agent Tasks:**
- Create infrastructure documentation
- Write deployment and setup guides
- Document security procedures and policies
- Create operational runbooks
- Write troubleshooting guides
- Create compliance documentation

## Example Implementation

### DevOps Engineer Agent Configuration

```yaml
name: devops-engineer
description: "DevOps specialist with security focus"
mode: "primary"
system_prompt: |
  You are a DevOps Engineer agent specializing in secure infrastructure:
  1. Design scalable and secure infrastructure
  2. Implement proper CI/CD pipelines with security integration
  3. Use Infrastructure as Code principles
  4. Implement proper monitoring and observability
  5. Prioritize security in all configurations
  6. Delegate security reviews to security-auditor agent
  7. Delegate documentation to documentation-writer agent
tools: ["read_file", "write_file", "apply_patch", "bash", "grep", "think"]
can_delegate: true
max_steps: 40
```

### Sample Infrastructure Code

#### Dockerfile with Security Best Practices

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for security and size optimization
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

# Set security-focused environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1 \
    PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1

# Create non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser

# Install dependencies with security checks
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && \
    pip install safety bandit

# Production stage
FROM python:3.11-slim as production

# Copy only necessary files
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin

# Create non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser

# Set secure working directory
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Change ownership to non-root user
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "app:app"]
```

## Sample Conversation Flow

```
User: I need to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for my web application with Docker containerization...

DevOps Engineer: I'll help you create a secure, production-ready CI/CD pipeline with all the security measures you need. Let me start by designing the infrastructure and creating the necessary configurations.

[DevOps Engineer creates Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD pipeline]

DevOps Engineer: I've created the basic infrastructure with security considerations. Now I'll delegate a comprehensive security audit to ensure everything meets security standards.

DevOps Engineer: /delegate security-auditor "Please perform a comprehensive security audit of the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure I've designed..."

Security Auditor: I'll perform a thorough security audit of your infrastructure and pipeline.

[Security Auditor analyzes configurations, identifies vulnerabilities, provides recommendations]

DevOps Engineer: Thank you for the security recommendations. I'll implement all the suggested security measures and then create comprehensive documentation.

[DevOps Engineer implements security hardening]

DevOps Engineer: /delegate documentation-writer "Please create comprehensive documentation for the secure CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure..."

Documentation Writer: I'll create thorough documentation for your secure infrastructure.

[Documentation Writer creates setup guides, security procedures, runbooks]

DevOps Engineer: Perfect! Your secure CI/CD pipeline is now complete with all security measures implemented and comprehensive documentation.
```
