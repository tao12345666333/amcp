# Optimize code for better performance

description = "Analyze and optimize code for improved performance"

prompt = """
Please analyze and optimize the following code for better performance:

{{args}}

Provide:
1. Performance bottlenecks identification
2. Algorithmic improvements
3. Memory usage optimization
4. I/O operation optimizations
5. Caching strategies if applicable
6. Parallelization opportunities
7. Benchmarking suggestions

Consider:
- Time complexity (Big O)
- Space complexity
- Database query optimization
- Network request optimization
- Caching and memoization
- Lazy loading and evaluation
- Resource pooling

Include before/after comparisons when possible and explain the performance gains.
